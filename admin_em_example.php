Dear Coaches,
<br/>
We will be using an online system (same as last year’s) for the self-scheduled event.<br/><br/>

Every school will have their own username and password login, located at the end of this email.<br/><br/>
Sign up for each event is on a first come first serve basis starting at the date and time listed above.<br/><br/>
Once you have logged in, by default, you will be on the page with different events and time slots which you can sign up for.<br/>
 By clicking on “Get this time” in the time you want, you will have selected that time for this event and the slot will turn green and read “You have this slot.” 
 <br/>If you decide to select another time for this event, you can click the “Get this time” button for another time and it will automatically drop your original slot and get you the new slot.
<br/><br/>
You can review the time slots which you have signed up for by clicking on the tab on the top that says “View Your Event Times.” On this page, if you decide you do not want to participate in an event, you can click the “Drop This Slot” button to drop your time for that event. You can also go back to select and/or change your times afterwards by click on “Select Event Times.”
<br/><br/>
After the sign up period is over, you will still be able to log in and click on the “View Your Event Times” tab to see the events and time you have signed up for.
<br/><br/>
Below is your school and log in information. If the school name below isn’t your school, please let me know ASAP. Thank you very much.
